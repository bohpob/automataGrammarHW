# Assignment: Ancient Language Decoder

This project implements a C++ program designed to determine whether
a given word belongs to a language defined by a specific grammar.
The grammar consists of production rules that are used to derive
words from non-terminal symbols, adhering to certain constraints.
The program will not only check the membership of the word but will
also trace back the derivation process if the word is part of the language.

## Features

- Determine if a word belongs to a language defined by a set of grammatical rules.
- Trace back the derivation of the word from the initial non-terminal symbol to the final word.
- Handle multiple grammar rules and maintain clarity in derivation sequences.
